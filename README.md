# AIGitCommit

A simple tool to help you write better Git commit messages using AI.

## Features

- Generates meaningful commit messages based on your code changes
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- By using the libgit2 library, there is no need to call an external command for security reasons.
- The system supports multiple AI models that are compatible with the OpenAI API.
- Supports integration with Git workflow (doing)

## How It Works

aigitcommit looks at your Git staged changes and uses AI to make commit lines that are clear and helpful. It looks at the diff result and uses machine learning to figure out what your changes were meant to do and why you made them. It then generates a commit message that is clear and helpful.
